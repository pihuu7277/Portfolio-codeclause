        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>"Hello! I'm Pragati, a passionate and creative web developer and designer based in Jalgaon. With a strong
          foundation in front-end and back-end web technologies, I enjoy creating beautiful and user-friendly websites
          that leave a lasting impression. Throughout my journey as a developer, I have worked on various projects,
          honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other modern frameworks and libraries. I thrive in
          collaborative environments and believe that effective communication and teamwork are essential in delivering
          successful projects. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new design trends, reading tech blogs, or
          pursuing my passion for sketching. I am currently open to exciting opportunities and eager to contribute my
          expertise to innovative projects. Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch if you'd like to work
          together!"</p>
